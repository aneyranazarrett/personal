## Andrea

I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Political Economy and Government program (Economics track) at Harvard University. I am broadly interested in personnel, labor, and public economics, with a particular interest in how organizations and governments shape labor productivity.

I hold a Master in Public Policy (MPP) from the Harvard Kennedy School, where I was a Fulbright-García Robles Scholar, and a BA in Economics from ITAM (Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México). Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked as a research assistant at the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
