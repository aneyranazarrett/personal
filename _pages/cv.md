## Research Projects

### [Training Within Firms](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/25-045_1c5a1d13-a61d-41d2-b8b4-2e5971ea23e0.pdf)  
*Brayan Diaz, Andrea Neyra-Nazarrett, Julian Ramirez, Raffaella Sadun, Jorge Tamayo*  
This paper explores the organizational frictions that hinder training implementation within firms, focusing on the role of middle managers. Using data from three large Latin American firms—a car manufacturer, a quick-service restaurant chain, and a retailer—we show that middle managers who promote employee development boost training take-up and improve performance. Managerial rotations and event study methods reveal that “High Training” managers increase participation by up to 60%. The findings underscore the importance of embedding managerial behavior into human capital policy design.

### An Anatomy of Managerial Attention: Evidence from Retail  
*Achyuta Adhvaryu, Parker Howell, Andrea Neyra-Nazarrett, Anant Nyshadham, Jorge Tamayo*  
This study examines how managerial attention to complexity drives productivity in a large Colombian retail firm. High-performing managers reduce stockouts, streamline inventory, simplify product assortments, and improve pricing. Manager arrival leads to staffing changes toward sales, pricing, and inventory roles. Using AKM fixed effects and survey data, we document specific behavioral and organizational responses that explain performance variation in complex operational settings.

### VAT Holidays as Short-Term Economic Stimuli: The Case of Colombia’s “Días sin IVA”  
*José Martinez-Carrasco, David Muñoz, Andrea Neyra-Nazarrett, Alejandro Rasteletti, Diego Zamora*  
We evaluate Colombia’s VAT holiday policy (2020–2022) using 1.3 billion Bancolombia transactions. A repeated regression discontinuity design finds a 14% increase in sales during DSI events, with durable goods like electronics experiencing the highest gains. Effects are strongest among stores serving low-income consumers. Results highlight the stimulus potential of well-designed, broad-based tax holidays in emerging economies.
